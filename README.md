# Jira Log Time Chrome Extension
Easily log time spent on Jira tasks directly from your browser with this convenient Chrome extension, saving you time and increasing productivity.

## Settings


### Jira Domain/URL

This is your Jira Domain URL, whether that be Server or Cloud. For example: `https://jira.atlassian.com/.

### Username/Email

Your Jira username.

### REST Api Token

This is your Jira server REST Api Token.


Default value is `/rest/api/2` because that is the default extension for most recent jira. 

If you are using older server of Jira it might be `/rest/api/1`.
